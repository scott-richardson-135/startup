[My Notes](notes.md)

This will be a simple implementation of the classic game *Hangman*, with a clean, Wordle-type aesthetic.

You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Elevator pitch

Hangle is a take on the classic word game *Hangman*. It is a classic for a reason, and Hangle will improve on the experience in several ways. Hangle will implement a large vocabulary and statistics to improve the experience and challenge you to learn more. Hangle is the ultimate test of your language and logic skills. It is a perfect game for people who like puzzles, and there will always be more challenges to test you.

### Key features

- Random word generation for unlimited puzzles.
- Responsive and interactive UI for clean gameplay experience.
- Login and authentication so users can track statistics.
- Score sharing for comparison with other users.
- Keyboard for players to guess individual letters and a text input for guessing the entire word.

  
### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Foundation of my site. There will be two HTML pages- login and main game window.
- **CSS** - Styling my website. I plan to use a clean, simple design that takes inspiration from the popular *Wordle*-type games. 
- **React** - React will be used to build the dynamic parts of my website, such as making guesses or changing the game state. 
- **Service** - Endpoints for authentication and storing statistics. My website will connect with an API to get random words so that there is greater diversity and randomization in the challenge of the Game. Probably something like [Random Word API](https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/home).
- **DB/Login** - Users will be able to register and login and their credentials are stored. They will be able to view their game statistics and history.
- **WebSocket** - My website will use websocket to notify players when another player completes a puzzle and their score.
